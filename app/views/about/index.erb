      <h3>about me</h3>
      <p>I'm surrounded by nerds. I work with them and I even live with one. But I'm not a nerd, no I'm too cool for that. Sure, I prefer to stay home and read most nights rather than going out clubbing or whatever kids do these days. I am not adverse to watching movies like Krull and i've even enjoyed learning to play Magic the Gathering, but I am not a nerd. I also have a severe case of obsessive compulsive disorder forcing me to clean my apartment to an impeccable degree. And I love fuzzy kitties and puppies. I aspire to have a nice big house one day where my French Bulldog (who's name shall be McGruber) and I can roam freely and happily.</p>
      <p>That's me in a nut shell. Here's me as a professional:</p>
      <p>I am a designer and developer interested in user interfaces and website implementation. My experience ranges from the design phase to front-end development as well as some minor back-end programming. I am well versed in graphic design tools such as photoshop and illustrator and I have experience developing in xhtml, css, javascript, and to a lesser extent ruby on rails, php and mysql.</p>
